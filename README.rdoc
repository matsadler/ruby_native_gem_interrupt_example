= Uninterruptible Ruby Native Extension

This repo contains some examples of a Ruby Native extension that stops Ruby
from responding to signals, plus workarounds. The examples are with Rust and
the Magnus crate, but apply equally to C - or any other language - native 
extensions.

These examples are structured as a gem, with runnable examples as gem
executables, run them like:

  bundle install
  rake compile
  bundle exec example_ruby_loop_delayed_int
